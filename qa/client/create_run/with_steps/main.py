"""
Example script demonstrating how to create a test run in TofuPilot with detailed steps.

This script runs a series of test functions, records the results and duration of each step,
and then creates a test run in TofuPilot. Each step includes detailed information such as
the measured value, unit, and thresholds.

Ensure your API key is stored in the environment variables as per the documentation:
